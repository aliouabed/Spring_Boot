# Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a project within the Spring ecosystem aimed at simplifying the process of configuring and deploying applications based on Spring. It provides a conventional platform that allows developers to focus on the business logic of their application, reducing the need for specific configuration and accelerating the development process. Spring Boot has become a popular choice for developing web applications, microservices, and enterprise applications.

### Main Features of Spring Boot

- **Auto-configuration:** Spring Boot attempts to auto-configure your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project. For example, if the Spring Security library is in your classpath, Spring Boot automatically configures basic security for your application.

- **Rapid Start:** It offers default configurations to quickly start developing Spring applications. You can start a new Spring Boot application with little or no initial configuration.

- **Opinionated Defaults:** Spring Boot offers "opinions" on how to configure Spring, providing default choices to minimize the required configuration.

- **Production-ready:** It includes built-in features for application management, such as monitoring and application health, thus making it easier for applications to move to production.

- **Support for Various Persistence Types:** Spring Boot facilitates integration with relational and non-relational database management systems, providing auto-configuration for tools like JPA, JdbcTemplate, and Spring Data.

- **Support for Microservices Development:** With its auto-configuration system and embedded server (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), Spring Boot is ideal for developing microservices.
